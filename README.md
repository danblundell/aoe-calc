#Attachment of Earnings Calculator

Started as an experiment in php about two years ago, revisited it and migrated to a fully javascript version using [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/)

Still needs refinement but it's in working order.

The calculator returns a deduction figure based on council tax legislation. Deductions are based on both earnings and the number of attachment of earnings orders.

The styling is from Dan Cederholms [Pears](http://pea.rs)

Feel free to reuse for your own needs - only changes required should be in the single stylesheet.

Please contribute if you can refactor the .js into more simple code.
