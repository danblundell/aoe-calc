Deductions are based on both net earnings and the number of attachment of earnings orders.\r\n\r\nStarted as an experiment in php about two years ago, revisited it and migrated to a JavaScript only version using [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) as a quick-deploy framework.\r\n\r\nStill needs code refinement but the functionality is in working order.\r\n\r\nThe styling is from Dan Cederholms [Pears](http://pea.rs) and is all contained in style.css\r\n\r\nFeel free to reuse for your own needs - only changes required should be in the single stylesheet.\r\n\r\nPlease contribute if you can refactor the .js into more simple code.","note":"Don't delete this file!
